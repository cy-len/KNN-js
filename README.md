# KNN-js
A quick implementation of K-Nearest-Neighbours in pure JavaScript

All the stuff related to KNN is located in the "KNNBrain" class, everything else is a little implementation with a placeholder dataset in the file "dataset.js", which classifies a disease given some symptoms. Please note that nothing is optimized yet.
